### Example Interaction

```
‚úì Connected to gemma:2b model successfully!
Welcome to Dod Bot! I'm here to help with your daily enquiries.
You can ask me any daily life-related questions. Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end the conversation.

User: How can I stay focused while studying?
Dod Bot is getting your response...
Dod Bot: Try the Pomodoro technique: work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break to maintain concentration. Create a dedicated study space free from distractions like phones or social media. Use active recall methods like flashcards or teaching concepts aloud to engage your brain more effectively. What subject are you finding most challenging to focus on?

User: I want to wake up earlier but I keep oversleeping
Dod Bot is getting your response...
Dod Bot: Set your alarm across the room so you have to physically get up to turn it off. Go to bed 15 minutes earlier each night until you reach your target bedtime gradually. Expose yourself to bright light immediately upon waking to reset your circadian rhythm naturally. What time are you currently going to bed?

User: quit
Exiting the chatbot. Goodbye!
```

  - Orders (cancellation, tracking)
  - Refunds (initiation, process)
  - Discounts (student discounts)

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required packages (commented out in current version):
  - `requests`
  - `python-dotenv`

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. **Create your environment file**:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file and add your actual API key
   echo 'my_api = "your_actual_api_key_here"' > .env
   ```
4. Install dependencies (if using API features):
   ```bash
   pip install requests python-dotenv
   ```

> **🔐 Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It contains sensitive API keys that should remain private.

## 📋 Usage

### Basic Usage (Current Configuration)

The script will:

1. Prompt for your question
2. Ask for company name
3. Generate and display a formatted FAQ template prompt

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

**⚠️ Security Notice**: The `.env` file is excluded from version control for security reasons.

2. **Edit your `.env` file** and add your API key:

   ```
   my_api = "your_actual_api_key_here"

Examples of the perfect response format:

- Question: "I'm always tired in the morning. What can I do?"
Answer: "Try moving your bedtime 30 minutes earlier each night until you're getting 7-8 hours of sleep. Keep your bedroom cool and place your alarm across the room so you have to get up. Also, get bright light immediately when you wake up to reset your circadian rhythm. What time do you usually go to bed currently?"

- Question: "How can I save money on groceries?"
Answer: "Start by planning your meals for the week and making a detailed shopping list to avoid impulse buys. Shop the store's perimeter first where fresh foods are located, and choose generic brands for basics like rice and pasta—they're often 30-40% cheaper. Use your store's app to check weekly deals before you go. What's your biggest grocery expense right now?"

- Question: "I'm feeling stressed about work. Any tips?"
Answer: "Try the 5-5-5 breathing technique: breathe in for 5 seconds, hold for 5, breathe out for 5, and repeat for 5 minutes. Take proper lunch breaks away from your desk, even just 20 minutes helps reset your mind. Break big tasks into 25-minute focused sessions with 5-minute breaks between. What specific work situation is causing you the most stress?"

- Question: "How do I stay motivated to exercise?"
Answer: "Start with just 10-15 minutes daily at the same time each day—consistency beats intensity when building habits. Find an activity you actually enjoy rather than forcing yourself through something you hate. Track your progress with a simple calendar where you mark each completed workout to see your streak grow. What type of physical activities do you find fun?"

- Question: "What's a quick healthy breakfast I can make?"
Answer: "Try overnight oats: mix oats, milk, chia seeds, and fruit in a jar the night before—no cooking needed! Another super quick option is scrambled eggs with spinach on whole grain toast, takes just 2 minutes. For the busiest mornings, blend banana, spinach, protein powder, and almond butter into a smoothie. How much time do you usually have for breakfast in the morning?"
